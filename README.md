## Hi there! My name is Aleksandra ![peepoBlush](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/738425988463198278.webp?size=32&quality=lossless) 
But you can call me Ola, Alex, rebellka or this cool blonde gurl with a sense of humor 💅🏼 💜

Thanks for taking a look here! 👀 I either just applied to you for a job or you found me by accident or stalked me on the internet.

I'm a back-end python developer, focusing mainly on building and developing web applications - this also gives me the opportunity to expand my front-end skills, which are pretty good when it comes to knowing JavaScript, jQuery (yes, someone still uses that) or HTML5 and CSS.

I work as an analyst for business architecture and integration - I mainly work with data - analyze it, transform it, put it into a database and see if there is any added value from it. My duties also include being a product owner of two applications (yeeey!), being responsible for security issues related to the these applications, being responsible for maintaining the environment on Azure and Google Cloud Platform and other things that I don't know why I'm attached to it, but I like it and it gives me an opportunity to learn new things.
